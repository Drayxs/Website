					Tip Tap Mat is a smart door mat which allows you to open locked doors with your feet. By using your feet to tap the correct combination on the mat, a wireless signal is sent to the unlocker which unlocks a digital lock. Tip Tap Mat was invited to demo at the <a href = "http://www.globalgradshow.com/" target = "_blank">Global Grad Show</a> of <a href = "http://www.dubaidesignweek.ae/" target = "_blank">Dubai Design Week 2016</a>.<br>
